Welcome to CS 102 on GitHub! Here, you will find code repositories for all lectures, labs and programming assignments. 

This is our obligatory Hello World _public_ repository. If you only see this repository under the [CS 102 GitHub Organization Account](https://github.com/usc-csci102-spring2013) This means that you are yet to be designated as a member of this organization. This process starts by you. All you need to do is provide your GitHub account username to your TA/CP and you will be added within the first week of classes.
